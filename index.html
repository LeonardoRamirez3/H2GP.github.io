										<h2 class="major">Teams</h2>
										<p>Our High School's teams are composed of 5 people per. Usually, there are 2 drivers and 3 mechanics, however, it is suggested for ALL team members to have maximum knowledge on the car. We currently have 2 active teams, and we function in accordance with "Horizon's Hydrogen Grand Prix Rules and Regulations". We prepare for races together, nevertheless, we compete against each other in the driving aspect during race days.</p>

										<h2 class="major">My Roles</h2>
										<p>When I joined the team, my own personal focus was to become the best mechanic I could possibly be. 
										Gaining experience with both driving and being a mechanic helped me understand the best thing for the team is to become the best driver I could. Nevertheless, I always 
										did my best to become a great mechanic. I mastered focusing under pressure and even assisted 
										heavily when needing to replace important components of the car mid-race. I believe it is essential for drivers 
										to understand the full extent of what the car can handle to not break the car, but also to drive the 
										most efficiently. I am the lead driver and a lead assistant mechanic for my team.</p>

										<h2 class="major">Sustainability</h2>
										<p>The focus of the program is to use, improve, and innovate on Hydrogen technology. Being partnered with Toyota Mirai, much of the technology that we use is being used in the development of actual cars for the public. We use HydroSticks and plug them into a cupling which then have a tube that leads to the fuelcell which then through the process of electrolysis helps maximize the batteries efforts and makes the cars energy last up to 6 hours, while the Lithium-Polymer battery lasts up to 2 hours by itself. </p>

									<h2 class="major">Efficiency</h2>
									<p>A  huge part of the efficiency of the car is the driving itself, meaning that drivers need to be well versed in the cars capabilities as well as driving lines, hitting the apex in corners, everything that needs to be done in order to save energy and become the fastest in the grid. Aside from driving skills, we alter the car's settings in order to become the most efficient by changing rear tires, changing speed caps in the controllers system, choosing which batteries to use at certain times during the races, and other decisions like that. </p>

									<h2 class="major">Racing</h2>
									<p>Racing is the reason why we make all the changes we do to the car. We compete in 3 major competitions throughout the season and various official practice sessions. The first of the year is the Regionals competition, where regional teams compete to qualify for the State Finals. In States, teams from all around California and neighboring states compete to achieve the top 3 places. If this is achieved, those 3 teams get to compete in the World Finals competition. The location usually varies in locations throughout Europe, however, the last World Finals competition I competed in was located in Las Vegas, Nevada.</p>
